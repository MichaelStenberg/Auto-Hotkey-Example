Hello Everyone!

This is just more or less a self reference of usable Auto-Hotkey scripts or concepts I may use.  This includes a copy/paste specific output for now as well as one where you can enter one output then enter/key presses and the next output later.

The above can be useful as it can help either type output or it can help to run specific queries for writing details for people.  In my case I use the system to enter a username/password for a computer to quickly login easier the first time.

The raw output used in my example is helpful when using consoles such as Putty, cmd.exe, Windows Bash Shell, Ubuntu or alternate windows where you might have to otherwise configure the system to allow the writing/input of lines to the code which isn't something always or natively available in some cases.

Either way; as more is added I'll have more added here and hopefully include more examples or detailed explanations down the road as I work to expand the test site/blog (which my goal is to use it to allow me to further explain the above with a blog style format).
